# odin-recipes
Made my first ever project "Odin Recipes" entirely with HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) while learning from the Odin Project.

I learnt about the following things:-

       1. HTML Boilerplate.
       2. Explored bolds,italics and headings.
       3. Learnt about paragraphs.
       4. Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists.
       5. Embedding images and hyperlinks and their attributes.
       6. How to open hyperlinks in new tabs(use of noopener and noreferrer) and its other applications.
