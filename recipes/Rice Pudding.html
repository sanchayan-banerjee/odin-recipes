        <h2><strong>How To Make Rice Pudding Step by Step</strong></h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade rice pudding:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice.</li>
            <li>Cook the cooked rice, some of the milk, sugar, and salt over medium heat until thick.</li>
            <li>Stir in the remaining milk, egg, and raisins. Cook for two more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla.</li>
            <li>You can freeze homemade rice pudding. Ladle the pudding into freeze-safe bags, leaving about an inch of space at the top to allow for expansion. Freeze flat for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight or in the microwave using the defrost setting.</li>
        </ol>
